        1. Conserve energy in your everyday life.
        <hr>
        <br>
        Making simple choices to save energy  may help avoid the serious consequences of global warming. For example:
        Turn off the lights.
        Close doors immediately so heat does not escape.
        Take short showers.
        Walk or bike if you can (instead of having your parents drive you).
        Turn off your computer when not in use (don't leave it on just to keep Facebook or Myspace active).
        We can make simple choices to save energy.

        2. Convince the people around you to save energy.
        <hr>
        <br>
        Now, you have to be careful here because people don't like to be told what to do, so convince is the important part. Your parents would be perfect subjects for persuasion, but do it with love and humor. Here are some suggestions that you can provide for your family and friends.
        Replace incandescent with fluorescent lights. (This saves a lot of money!)
        Ask your parents not to leave the car running needlessly, for example, when waiting to pick you up at school.
        Recycle  (this saves energy in manufacturing).
        Run the dishwasher and other appliances on energy saver mode.
        Keep the house at 68¬∞F or less. And make sure the heat goes off at night and when everyone is away.
        Start a conservation club at school to raise awareness. Get your fellow students and teachers on board to have the school reduce energy consumption.

        It takes energy to produce everything we buy. We can save energy by recycling.
        
        In fact, not knowing is one of the problems. Global warming is a significant risk to society. On the one hand, we do not know exactly what will happen. On the other, we realize that what could happen could be serious. And these consequences could affect different parts of the world in different ways.
        
        3. Keep learning.
        
        These ideas all involve conservation. While that's important, what's more important is finding and implementing sources of energy that do not pollute the environment. Who is going to do that? It can be you! So the third and most important thing you can do is get the best education you can get, so that you can be a responsible citizen and continue making good decisions. Maybe you will help find scientific, technological, economic, or political solutions to the present situation.</h2>
        <h1>//16 solutions for climate change//</h1>
        <h2>

            1-It may sound obvious, but powering your home with solar or wind is still one of the best ways to fight climate change.Depending on where you live, you may be able to switch to a power company that provides energy from renewables. Or you can consider getting solar installed on your home.
           <br>2-You can fight climate change simply by changing what you eat. You can significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions by eating less meat, choosing local foods when possible and buying food with less packaging.
           <br>3-Saving water at home is another way to fight climate change. Why? Because the clean water that‚Äôs pumped to most homes in North America has been treated, which uses lots of energy.
           <br>4-You can make a sustainable choice every time you need to go somewhere: choose a fuel efficient vehicle when purchasing, take public transportation if it‚Äôs available, carpool to work, ride a bicycle or walk when possible. These are all ways to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere and heating our planet.
           <br>5-Buy less new things, and always remeber the 6rs bcause There are carbon emissions embedded in all the things we use day-to-day. When you buy fewer new things, you shrink your carbon footprint.
           <br>6-Recycling. Yes, recycling really can help stop climate change! That‚Äôs because re-using materials usually uses less energy, and thus creates less pollution, than extracting raw materials.
           <br>7- If you own your own home, consider installing a smart thermostat. Smart thermostats learn your routines and adjust your home‚Äôs temperature for peak efficiency, saving money on energy bills while decreasing emissions.
           <div id="pooopy"><h1>Dont forget,taking public transport really makes a difference!</h1></div>
           <br>8-Can changing a lightbulb really have an impact? If every household in the United State switched just ONE regular bulb to a CFL or LED bulb it would be equivalent to removing 1 million cars from the road!
           <br>9-Look for the ENERGY STAR label, which helps consumers identify products that are 10-to-50% more efficient. Categories include appliances, electronics, office equipment and many more. Smart appliances simply use less energy.
           <br>10-Do something called an ‚Äúenergy audit‚Äù to save money and energy in your home. You can hire a company (some even perform the audit remotely), but you can do it yourself too!
           <br>11-Want to save on your energy bills? One of the best ways is to insulate your home. According to the Department of Energy, properly sealing off drafts can reduce your bills by 5-30 percent.
           <br>12-Compost food scraps. According to the EPA, about 18 percent of methane pollution comes from food scraps that ended up in landfills. But if those leftovers, peels, cores and cuttings were composted, they would reduce emissions and help protect healthy soil. Learn more about composting here.
           <br>13-See if you qualify for PACE. Property Assessed Clean Energy, or PACE, is a way to finance climate-smart building upgrades, like lighting improvements, solar panels, efficient heating and cooling, and even insulation. Learn more here.
           <br>14-Calculate your carbon footprint with an online carbon calculator. Knowing what activities are your biggest sources of emissions helps you plan how to reduce your footprint. Check out this calculator from The Nature Conservancy to find out what part of your life contributes the most to climate change.
           <br>15-Eliminate your junk mail! Go here to find out how.
           <br>16-Plant trees, to help suck carbon out of the air and stabilize the climate.</h2>
